# WAVES Mobile Player for Virtual Patiens


# The WAVES Project

The WAVES project combines skill sets of both academic and enterprise partners to make Scenario-based learning (SBL) more accessible for a wide range of professions.  SBL techniques are widely recognised as a key tool in the educational toolkit, for safe training in competency and decision-making.

# Main tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

Tasks                         | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm start                     | Run development server on `http://localhost:4200/`
npm run build [-- --env=prod] | Lint code and build app for production in `dist/` folder
npm test                      | Run unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) in watch mode
npm run test:ci               | Lint code and run unit tests once for continuous integration
npm run e2e                   | Run e2e tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org)
npm run lint                  | Lint code
npm run translations:extract  | Extract strings from code and templates to `src/app/translations/template.json`
npm run docs                  | Display project documentation

When building the application, you can specify the target environment using the additional flag `--env <name>` (do not
forget to prepend `--` to pass arguments to npm scripts).

The default build environment is `prod`.

## Development server

This project was generated with [ngX-Rocket](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/generator-ngx-rocket/)
version 1.3.3

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend proxy configuration by default.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can also use
`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

If you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,
you can also use the command `ng generate` directly.

## Additional tools

Tasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

# What's in the box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com). The translation files use the common [JSON](http://www.json.org) format.

#### Tools

Development, build and quality processes are based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and
[NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), which includes:

- Optimized build and bundling process with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
- [Development server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) with backend proxy and live reload
- Cross-browser CSS with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and
  [browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)
- Asset revisioning for [better cache management](https://webpack.github.io/docs/long-term-caching.html)
- Unit tests using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
- End-to-end tests using [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor)
- Static code analysis: [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint), [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer),
  [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io) and [HTMLHint](http://htmlhint.com/)
- Local knowledgebase server using [Hads](https://github.com/sinedied/hads)
